"""
    This is our data processing API. Here we can define functions that are easy to understand,
    where the implementation details are abstracted to places like model.py, angle.py, etc.

    Eventually, we should have functions here like "processNewData(...)" and others that can be
    configured to automatically fire based on UI events.

    This might not be the right approach for the final implementation, but I think something of
    this nature will be useful for maintaining synchronization with the other teams who will/have
    contribute(d) to the project.
